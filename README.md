## 1. Introduction

The **Material UI IMDB Clone** project was designed to provide an interactive way to learn about the various components offered by the Material UI library in the context of building a movie rating application. By following this documentation, you'll be able to grasp the fundamentals of Material UI, understand how to integrate its components into a React application, and create a simple yet functional movie rating app.

## 2. Project Overview

In this project, we've created a movie rating application similar to IMDB, allowing users to view a list of movies and rate them. The application utilizes Material UI components to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

## 3. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version >= 12.0.0)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## 4. Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deciever002/MaterialUI-IMDB.git

   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 5. Usage
